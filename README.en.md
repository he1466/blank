## Introduction

> A markdown resume creation tool that can convert your written resume to PDF and support multiple templates, completely free.

Advantages:

1. Traditional resume creation method is through UI interface to fill in the form/drag and drop to generate the resume, the process is more complex and tedious. The resume layout based on markdown writing will be very easy to expand, and it is easy to operate. In addition to the commonly used markdown syntax, multiple column layout (Flex) syntax has been added, and the usage will be introduced later.

2. If you are not satisfied with the design of the resume, you can completely change the resume matching by yourself, greatly improving the scalability of the resume.

3. The resume is smartly one page, solving the embarrassing situation caused by too little or too much resume content.

4. Provide a resume community to share the experience during the job search process (the original intention was to establish a platform that combines resumes and interview experiences).
